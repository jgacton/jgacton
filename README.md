# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, and I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance, data science or research. I am currently pursuing internships in these areas for the summer of 2023. 

I have experience programming in C, Haskell and R (University), Java (School and University), Python (School and an internship) and web development with HTML, CSS and Node.js.

This Github repository showcases some of my programming projects and work to date, including both university coursework assignments and my own personal adventures.
