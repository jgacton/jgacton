# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, and I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am interested in pursuing higher education and a career in quantitative finance or data science/analytics.  

I have experience programming in Python, R, C, Java and Haskell as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web development across a variety of school and university courses as well as my own learning and online courses.

In support of my own internship applications, I created a flexible CV template in LaTeX which I have uploaded to Github [here]([https://](https://github.com/jgacton/LaTeX-CV-Template)). Feel free to download it, modify it as you need and make use of it.
