# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, and I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am interested in pursuing higher education and a career in quantitative finance or data science/analytics.  

I have experience programming in C, Haskell and R (University), Java (School and University), Python (School and an internship) and web development with HTML, CSS and Node.js.

This Github repository showcases some of my programming projects and work to date, including both university coursework assignments and my own personal adventures.

At the moment I am self studying the textbook 'Paul Wilmott introduces Quantitative Finance'. As I go, I am implementing things described in the book using Python both to help gain an intuitive understanding of the content and to sharpen my Python skills. This is detailed in one of the repositories below.
