# Hello!

My name is Josh, and I am a postgraudate student studying for an MSc in Applicable Mathematics at the London School of Economics. Previously I was an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am pursuing a career in quantitative finance or data science.

I have experience programming in Python, R, C, C++, Java and Haskell as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web development across a variety of school and university courses as well as my own learning and online courses.

In support of my own internship applications, I created a flexible CV template in LaTeX which I have uploaded to Github [here](https://github.com/jgacton/LaTeX-CV-Template). Feel free to download it, modify it as you need and make use of it.
