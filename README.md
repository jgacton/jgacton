# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, and I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance, data science or research. 

I have experience programming in C, Haskell and R (University), Java (School and University), Python (School) and web development with HTML, CSS and Node.js. In my spare time I would like to get further in depth with Python for data science and C++.

This Github repository showcases some of my programming projects and work to date, including both university coursework assignments and my own personal adventures.
